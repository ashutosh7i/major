Hello and greetings from team Geeks.js,
=> Our solution integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot into Walmart's e-commerce platform.
This AI-powered assistant leverages the context of Walmart's entire product catalog & user's data to provide a highly personalized shopping experience.
Here's how our solution works:

1. Personalized Product Search: Users can search for products using chat, describing their needs conversationally. The chatbot understands context and preferences, suggesting the most relevant products.
2. Product Recommendations: Based on user interactions, purchase history, and current queries, the bot provides tailored product recommendations, increasing the likelihood of purchases.
3. Product Comparisons: Users can easily compare multiple products, with the bot highlighting key differences and similarities, helping in decision-making.
4. Review Summaries: The bot can provide concise summaries of product reviews, saving users time and offering quick insights.
5. Ratings Analysis: It can interpret and explain product ratings, giving users a clear understanding of product quality and customer satisfaction.
6. Order Tracking: Users can inquire about their order status through the chat interface, receiving real-time updates.
7. Shopping Insights: The system gathers valuable data on user preferences and shopping behaviors, which Walmart can use for inventory management and targeted marketing.

TechStack- we're using Next.js for the frontend, integrating it with Langchain for language processing, and Pinecone for efficient vector storage while following scalable patterns.

By providing this conversational and personalized shopping experience, we aim to significantly enhance user engagement, increase conversion rates, and provide Walmart with valuable customer insights, ultimately leading to increased sales and customer base.
